## What is Apexo?

Apexo is a UI harness for **Grok**. Its main purpose is to support
[Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build), SpaceXAI's official open-source coding
agent, and to make Grok easier for everyone to use, with a terminal UI, a web UI and a desktop
app on top of the same local agent server.

What you get today:

- **Grok first.** Sign in with your xAI account (SuperGrok, or X Premium where xAI grants
  Grok access) using xAI's OAuth device-code flow. No API key needed. An `XAI_API_KEY` works too.
  All current Grok models from the models.dev catalog are available, for example `grok-4.7`,
  `grok-4.6`, `grok-4.20` and `grok-build-0.1`.
- **Secondary providers via API key:** OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude) and Google (Gemini).
  No other providers or OAuth logins are included.
- **No paid subscription, no ads.** There is no hosted model gateway, account console,
  session sharing service, upsell or promotional content. Everything runs locally and talks
  directly to the provider you configure.
- **Terminal UI, web UI and desktop app** share one local server and one session history.
- **Grove theme**: a warm-dark/green default theme for both the TUI and the app. All of the
  classic themes are still available.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status of the Grok Build integration.** Apexo does not drive the Grok Build CLI yet. Today
> it runs its own agent loop against the xAI API, using your Grok login or API key. Running Grok
> Build itself behind Apexo's UI is the goal: Grok Build exposes an Agent Client Protocol (ACP)
> server through `grok agent stdio`, and Apexo already ships an ACP SDK. Until that lands,
> treat Apexo as a Grok-first UI and agent, not as a Grok Build frontend.

## Install (build from source)

Apexo is not published to package managers yet. To build it you need
[Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.x (the repo pins `bun@1.3.14`) and git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cluster1900/apexo-grok.git apexo && cd apexo
bun install

# Build a single native binary for this machine (the web UI is embedded)
bun run --cwd packages/opencode build --single

# The binary lands in packages/opencode/dist/opencode-<os>-<arch>/bin/apexo
# (an identical "opencode" binary is placed next to it for compatibility)
install -m755 packages/opencode/dist/opencode-*/bin/apexo ~/.local/bin/apexo
apexo --version
```

To run from source without building:

```bash
bun dev            # same as: bun run --cwd packages/opencode src/index.ts
bun dev --help
```

## Usage

```bash
apexo                     # start the terminal UI in the current directory
apexo auth login          # sign in: pick xAI -> "SuperGrok Subscription" (OAuth) or an API key
apexo auth list           # show configured credentials
apexo models xai          # list Grok models
apexo run "explain this repo"   # one-shot, non-interactive
apexo web                 # start the local server and open the web UI
apexo serve               # headless server (for the desktop app, editors, scripts)
apexo acp                 # run Apexo as an ACP agent for editors such as Zed
```

In the TUI, `/connect` opens the provider dialog, `/models` switches models, `/themes` switches
themes, and `ctrl+p` opens the command palette. Start a prompt with `!` to run a shell command.

### Providers

| Provider | How to connect | Environment variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **xAI Grok** (primary) | `apexo auth login`, then xAI -> SuperGrok Subscription (device-code OAuth), or an API key | `XAI_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | API key | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic (Claude) | API key | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Google (Gemini) | API key | `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` |

A generic OpenAI-compatible "custom provider" entry is still available for self-hosted endpoints.

### Desktop app

The Electron desktop app lives in `packages/desktop`:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/desktop dev        # development build
bun run --cwd packages/desktop build      # production bundle (packaging uses electron-builder)
```

The auto-updater is disabled because Apexo has no release feed yet.

## Configuration

Apexo reads JSON/JSONC config files. Apexo names are preferred and the OpenCode names are still
read, so existing setups keep working:

| What | Apexo | Also read (legacy) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global config dir | `~/.config/apexo/` (`apexo.jsonc`) | `~/.config/opencode/` (used if it exists and `apexo/` does not) |
| Data / state / cache | `~/.local/share/apexo`, `~/.local/state/apexo`, `~/.cache/apexo` | the matching `opencode` directories |
| Project config | `apexo.json` / `apexo.jsonc` | `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc` |
| Project directory | `.apexo/` (agents, commands, plugins, themes, tools) | `.opencode/` |
| Environment variables | `APEXO_*` (for example `APEXO_CONFIG`, `APEXO_CONFIG_CONTENT`) | `OPENCODE_*` |

When both exist in the same directory, `apexo.json` wins over `opencode.json`, and `APEXO_*`
wins over `OPENCODE_*`. Example `apexo.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "xai/grok-4.7",
  "theme": "grove"
}
```

The config format is the same as upstream OpenCode, so the
[OpenCode config reference](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/dev/packages/web/src/content/docs/config.mdx) applies.

## Themes

- **TUI:** `grove` is the default. Switch with `/themes`, or set `"theme"` in `tui.json`
  (`~/.config/apexo/tui.json`). Custom themes go in `.apexo/themes/*.json` or
  `~/.config/apexo/themes/`.
- **Web and desktop app:** Grove is the default in Settings -> Appearance. The original theme is
  listed as "Classic".

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun turbo typecheck --concurrency=3
(cd packages/core && bun test)
(cd packages/opencode && bun test)
(cd packages/tui && bun test)
```

Internal package names (`@opencode-ai/*`) and source directories (`packages/opencode`) keep
their upstream names on purpose, to keep merges from upstream manageable.
